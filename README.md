# Sleeper Points Above Expected
### V 1.0.0
A data visualization tool to show your Sleeper fantasy football roster's points above projected.
## About
This is a program that will show your Sleeper fantasy football roster's PPR fantasy points above projected via a bar chart. The program loops through your roster for each week of the season and calculates the players actual points - projected points and returns the total difference from each week so far in a season. The point of this program is to see which players are overperforming and which are underperforming. If a player has a high points above projected, they are likely overperforming, and if they have a low/negative points above projected, they are underperforming.

In the future, I plan to run some sort of model accuracy test to determine how accurate Sleepers projections are, because in the end, while we can draw conclusions about if a player is over/under performing, it's smart to keep in mind that the reason we make those conclusions could be because Sleepers point projection model isn't good. For the most part, based on an extremely general eye test (and you'll see in the sample provided in this README) the projections seem fairly accurate.
## How To Run

## Sample Output

This is the type of output we can expect after running the program. Just drawing some basic conclusions from this, we can see that Brandon Aiyuk is by far my most underperformig player. This checks out, as he has had a very underwheliming year compared to his incredible rookie season. In general, my team is underperforming, which also holds true as this roster is not putting up as many wins or points as much of the league expected.
